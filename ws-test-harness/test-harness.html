<h1>JAX-WS unit test harness proposal</h1>


</center>


<h1>Requirements</h1>


<ol>


  <li>Writing tests shouldn't require a lot of typing
and
copy&amp;pasting (there must be no boiler-plate code/configuration,
nor
duplication of data.) </li>


  <li>One must be able to run
individual test (if necessary under a
debugger) with any combination of additional system properties without
changing any build script.</li>


  <li>A failure in a test
(including failure to run tools such as
wscompile) must be detected, and other tests must not be affected by it.</li>


  <li>A test must be configuration agnostic; the same test should
be
reusable for different containers, different transports, different
encoding, etc.</li>


  <li>Tests must be runnable in parallel
to reduce turn-around time.</li>


  <li>Each test must not
launch&nbsp;new JVMs for performance as well as ease of debugging.</li>


  <li>This harness may not be able to support all the existing
JAX-WS
unit tests; the primary goal is to provide a good test harness for
projects building on top of JAX-WS.</li>


</ol>


<h1>User Experience</h1>


<p>A test case consists of:</p>


<ol>


  <li>metadata
XML file that describes a test, such as in which versions it applies
to, a test name, human-readable description, etc.</li>


  <li>optional
WSDL to generate server artifacts from</li>


  <li>server code
written in Java</li>


  <li>client code written in a scripting
language</li>


</ol>


Thus a test case could look something
like:<br>


<h4>test.meta</h4>


<pre>&lt;test name="simpleEchoTest" since="2.0.1"&gt;<br> &lt;wsdl href="foo.wsdl" /&gt;<br>&lt;/test&gt;</pre>


<h4>1.js</h4>


<pre>r = portFoo.echo("Hello");<br>assertEquals("Hello",r);</pre>


<h4>EchoService.java</h4>


<pre>package simpleEchoTest;<br><br>@WebService<br>public class EchoServiceImpl implements EchoService {<br> public String echo(String s) { return s; }<br>}</pre>


<p>Notice that the use of scripting language allows us to completely
remove any boilerplate code. The harness interprets all the ports and
injects a properly configured "portFoo" variable, as well as offer
convenience methods like <span class="code">assertEquals</span>&nbsp;(JAXB used <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell</a>, which has Java-compatible syntax)&nbsp;There
are some downsides
(like not being able to set breakpoints inside scripts), but the
experience with JAXB was that the benefits outweigh the cost. This also
makes it easy to evolve the harness without affecting the tests that
are already written.</p>

<p>Also note that there's no build script in a test
case. The harness figures out what needs to be done from the metadata.</p>

<p>Then one would run this like this:</p>

<pre>$ alias testWs=java -jar /path/to/harness.jar<br>$ testWs [... any options ...] path/to/test/case ...<br></pre>

<p>Options would include things like what container to use (if any), #
of threads to run tests, option to skip wscompile phase (useful for
repeated runs), etc.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>There's a tension between inferring more by harness vs letting test
code override details; Tango wants more inference to reduce the amount
of typing, but JAX-WS RI unit tests want more overrides so that it can
exercise various parts of the RI. The only way to solve this dilemma
seems to be to have two test harnesses.</p>

<p>So the harness itself needs to be written in a modular enough way so that two harnesses can share a large amount of code. </p>

<h1>Implementation
Consideration</h1>


<ol>

  <li>Use
JUnit behind the scene to run tests and tally the result. Use it
smartly --- there's a lot more in JUnit than writing a class that extends from <span class="code">TestCase</span> and define one method per
test. For example, we should be running wscompile inside JUnit, and you
can do those things.</li>


  <li>Calling Ant tasks from Java
program is pretty easy, and is a convenient way of performing some
tasks from the harness.</li>


  <li>Use <a href="http://cargo.codehaus.org/">Cargo</a>
to make
the harness&nbsp;container-agnostic. Do not rely on Ant for
operations like start/stop/deploy.</li>


  <li>Use <a href="http://forehead.sourceforge.net/">forehead</a>
or <a href="http://classworlds.codehaus.org/">classworlds</a>
to isolate components inside a single JVM.</li>


  <li>Use <a href="https://parallel-junit.dev.java.net/">parallel-junit</a>
to automatically parallelize JUnit-based tests.</li>


</ol>
